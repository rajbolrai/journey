    <p>
        1. Make 'mkdir directory_name' directory or 'cd' into the correct directory <br>
        2. Make virtual environment 'python3 -m venv venv_name' <br>
        3. Activate the virtual environment and add the relevant modules <br>
        4. Add the modules into a requirement txt file 'pip freeze > requirement.txt' <br>
        5. Create a .gitignore file and add virutal folder so git ignores it<br>
        6. Git init and create repository in Github and get url then link remote origin <br>
        7. Stage the project and commit then push it to main.

    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Classes </p>
    <p>
      Blueprint for object. Object can store data and replicate behaviour, thus, are used to represent model entities for example car object<br>
      Defined by class classname():<br>
      __init__(self) is used to initialise the class<br>
      The 'self' keyword must be the first argument of every method within the class. <br>It represent the current instance of the class. 
      An instance will have access to all its public variables and methods. <br>
      __str__ : method to have in each class. A more descriptive way to represents the custom object<br>
      __repr__: method to have in each class. Concise way to represents the custom object<br>
      
      
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Multiple Classes </p>
    <p>When creating mult-class system, rememeber to: <br>
      1. Use the ‘single responsibility’ principle for modules or classes.<br>
      2. Use the ‘open-closed’ principle for extending the functionality of the program.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);"> Nested list and dictionary </p>
    <p>
    Nested Dictionary is a dictonary where each key is the dictionary name and the value is a dictionary. <br>
    List of dictionary contains dictionary at each entry.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);"> Testing </p>
    <p>
    Unit tests are for testing functions or singular classes <br>
    Integration test is a test that tests multiple classes that are coupled together. It checks for their functionality.<br>
    Error handling: Remember to catch the correct error type. Makes it easier to organise and see.<br>


    Mocking is useful when you want to test the functionality of a module or class without relying 
    on referenced classes. It allows you to isolate the module, so if anything goes wrong, then it is the module’s or classes’ fault, not that of the coupled classes. <br>
    Using mocks for API tests and to turn anything that is non-deterministic to a deterministic value <br> 
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Relational Database</p>
    <p>
    The choice of Relational Database for these projects is PostgreSQL. <br>
    Database tables consist of:<br>
    - columns: attributes of a row<br>
    - row: singular object like structure that houses varius data<br>
    Also tables can be linked to each other using a special column called keys, hence the name relational<br>
    Each tabe has a primary key that PostgreSQL assigns. A table can reference another table by storing the other's primary key in a column in what is known as 'foreign key'<br>
    <br>
    Seeds are initial sets of data which can be used to populate a database and its tables<br>
    <br>
    Querying data syntax:<br>
    SELECT [list of columns] FROM [table_name];<br>
    <br>
    Updating a value:<br>
    UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value];<br>
    <br>
    Deleting a specific rows that match a certain condition <br>
    DELETE FROM [table_name] WHERE [conditions];<br>
    <br>
    Adding new row<br>
    INSERT INTO [table_name]<br>
      ( [list of columns] )<br>
    VALUES( [list of values] );<br> 
    <br>
    To turn the data obtained from PostgreSQL, use a ‘Model’ and ‘Repository’ classes (sometimes called ORM). 
    Model class will hold a record’s data, for example, an attribute for each column.
    A repository class holds methods to run SQL queries on the database to retrieve, create, update or delete data.
