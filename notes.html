    <p>
        1. Make 'mkdir directory_name' directory or 'cd' into the correct directory <br>
        2. Make virtual environment 'python3 -m venv venv_name' <br>
        3. Activate the virtual environment and add the relevant modules <br>
        4. Add the modules into a requirement txt file 'pip freeze > requirement.txt' <br>
        5. Create a .gitignore file and add virutal folder so git ignores it<br>
        6. Git init and create repository in Github and get url then link remote origin <br>
        7. Stage the project and commit then push it to main.

    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Classes </p>
    <p>
      Blueprint for object. Object can store data and replicate behaviour, thus, are used to represent model entities for example car object<br>
      Defined by class classname():<br>
      __init__(self) is used to initialise the class<br>
      The 'self' keyword must be the first argument of every method within the class. <br>It represent the current instance of the class. 
      An instance will have access to all its public variables and methods. <br>
      __str__ : method to have in each class. A more descriptive way to represents the custom object<br>
      __repr__: method to have in each class. Concise way to represents the custom object<br>
      
      
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Multiple Classes </p>
    <p>When creating mult-class system, rememeber to: <br>
      1. Use the ‘single responsibility’ principle for modules or classes.<br>
      2. Use the ‘open-closed’ principle for extending the functionality of the program.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);"> Nested list and dictionary </p>
    <p>
    Nested Dictionary is a dictonary where each key is the dictionary name and the value is a dictionary. <br>
    List of dictionary contains dictionary at each entry.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);"> Testing </p>
    <p>
    Unit tests are for testing functions or singular classes <br>
    Integration test is a test that tests multiple classes that are coupled together. It checks for their functionality.<br>
    Error handling: Remember to catch the correct error type. Makes it easier to organise and see.<br>


    Mocking is useful when you want to test the functionality of a module or class without relying 
    on referenced classes. It allows you to isolate the module, so if anything goes wrong, then it is the module’s or classes’ fault, not that of the coupled classes. <br>
    Using mocks for API tests and to turn anything that is non-deterministic to a deterministic value <br> 
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 34, 255);">Relational Database</p>
    <p>
    The choice of Relational Database for these projects is PostgreSQL. <br>
    Database tables consist of:<br>
    - columns: attributes of a row<br>
    - row: singular object like structure that houses varius data<br>
    Also tables can be linked to each other using a special column called keys, hence the name relational<br>
    Each tabe has a primary key that PostgreSQL assigns. A table can reference another table by storing the other's primary key in a column in what is known as 'foreign key'<br>
    <br>
    Seeds are initial sets of data which can be used to populate a database and its tables<br>
    <br>
    Querying data syntax:<br>
    SELECT [list of columns] FROM [table_name];<br>
    <br>
    Updating a value:<br>
    UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value];<br>
    <br>
    Deleting a specific rows that match a certain condition <br>
    DELETE FROM [table_name] WHERE [conditions];<br>
    <br>
    Adding new row<br>
    INSERT INTO [table_name]<br>
      ( [list of columns] )<br>
    VALUES( [list of values] );<br> 
    <br>
    To turn the data obtained from PostgreSQL, use a ‘Model’ and ‘Repository’ classes (sometimes called ORM). 
    Model class will hold a record’s data, for example, an attribute for each column.
    A repository class holds methods to run SQL queries on the database to retrieve, create, update or delete data.
    <br><br>
    A schema is useful for designing tables and their properties.<br><br>
    Relationship in tables:<br>
    - one to many <br>
    - many to many <br><br>
    In one-to-many, the many has the foreign key that links to the one table<br>
    A JOIN query is used to retrieve data from more than one table. Without using this process it would take twice as many queries and make program/database slow.<br><br>
    SELECT [columns to select]
    FROM [table name]
    JOIN [other table name]
    ON [join condition]<br><br>

    Many-to_Many<br>
    - Both table has a relationsip with multiple tables <br>
    - A join table is used to connect these two; it links their id to each other <br><br>

    SELECT [columns to select]<br>
    FROM [table name]<br>
    JOIN [join table] ON [join condition]<br>
    JOIN [other table] ON [join condition]<br>
    WHERE [condition]<br><br>

    <p>It is essential to understand the distinction between client and server. <br>
    Client is a software that connects to the server to obtain data or input data in some capacity. 
    The server is essentially another computer that has connection with the database and can run operations 
    that the user has requested from their client machine.<br><br>
    HTTP<br>
    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a language used to help connect clients to the their specified server on the internet (network).
    HTTP acts as the roadman creating a path between the client to the server so that they can communicate with each other.<br>
    The request and reponse cycle refer to how the client and server interaction procedes.<br><br> 

    There is 4 main HTTP Request methods:<br>

    - Post: creating/uploading data to the server’s database<br>
    - Get: read data, specify what to get <br>
    - Put: updating database entries <br>
    - Delete: removing database entries<br><br>

    The typical request line includes the method, path and HTTP version and headers provide extra infromation about the request.<br>
    The typical response from the server is made up of a status code indicating how the request went and a body which is the content returned.<br><br>


    MVC:<br>
    - Model: it models the how data is handled, structured and viewed<br>
    - Controller: part of the application that handles user request and provide appropriate responses for the client.<br>
    - View: it controls how the response is structured and represented to the user<br><br>

    Testing MVC:<br>

    1. Database integreations Tests for data repository classes to ensure database functions is correctly implemented<br>
    2. Unit tests the model class to check things are structered correctly<br><br>

    Feature Tests:<br>
    Test the whole MVC from the client's perspective.<br>
